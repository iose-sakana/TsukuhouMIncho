Tsukuho Minchou (築豊明朝) is a Kana typeface created with the traditional body text-oriented Mincho style of the Tsukiji No.5 series from the Tsukiji Tokyo Tsukiji Type Foundry in mind. While preserving traditional aspects, some of the context of Kana has been changed to emphasize the movement and softness of the brush. It has unique character shapes, and not only in the main text, but also in headings and titles, it may attract attention. The Kanji and Latin characters are borrowed from ‘ZEN Old Mincho Regular</p>
